# Tips on study techniques made ADHD friendly
So I was asked to redraw an explanation of how to do a synopsis for an oral exam. So I've already drawn this before. The point of the whole creative product to be a visual color coded guide to the ADHD brain on how to structure the synopsis for an oral exam.  

Having had to find tools for my own neuro divergent brain my whole life, now being a teacher at college - I KNOW I'm not the only one out there needing these tools. So this project aims to make an application for those who need the visual guide on how-to make everything from reports to synopsis and what else I might come up with. 

As I'm definetely not the only programmer, teacher or former student out there I will welcome any input and contribution to make this something everyone can use. 

## The stack
This is going to be a react app with some tailwind styling - The idea to make it scalable through a components based architecture. 

*(Also - this is wat I mainly teach at the moment and I need this tool quickly so keeping it familiar and simple)* :smirk:

## Now what
Now I'm going to make the actual app - this will be updated as I go along

**Have Fun** :metal:
